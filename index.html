    <h1> Electric Vehicle Annual Price Comparator</h1>
    <p1> How it works:</p1>
    <p2> Using various formulas based on the current price of gas,
        electricity, and average annual weather, we are able to determine
        what you're likely to pay per year on your car. Based on the
        average annual savings by using an EV, it's easy to see when you
        would 'break even' due to the higher upfront cost of an EV.
        This tool allows you to quickly compare various EV models to
        gasoline model vehicles to estimate with todays market how long
        it would take for you to save some money"
